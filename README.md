# Michael-Gordon13.github.io
The purpose of this repository is to contain all of the data/information relating to my portfolio website, which has been created as part of the Professional Development & Games Industry Employability module.

The webpage is divided into **four** main sections:
1. An About Me Section
2. What software I'm currently using (to be replaced with portfolio evidence in the future)
3. My skills (software, coding languages etc...)
4. Contact Details

Additionally, the webpage also includes hyperlinks to my pages on [LinkedIn] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-gordon13/) and [GitHub] (https://github.com/g010645m/).
